        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold p-3">1. what is the difference between map(), filter(), forEach(), find() ? </h3>
        <p><span class="font-semibold">Answer:</span> 
        map- map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element.it calls a function once for each element in an array.it does not execute the function for empty elements.it does not change the original array.</p>
        <p>forEach: The forEach() method calls a function for each element in an array.This method is not executed for empty elements.</p>
        <p>So we can call that map() and forEach() are similar but map must return an array and forEach don't return anything.</p>
        <p>filter(): it contains an condition. If the condition is true then it shows all the matching value.</p>
        <p>find(): It also contains a condition . If the condition is true then it shows only the first matching one.</p>
        <p>So, we can call that filter and find method are almost same. The difference is filter shows all of matching and find shows first matching one.</p>

        <p><span class="font-semibold">Answer:</span> All of those things are data saving format of browser.</p>
        <p>Local storage can store a data till it can delete manually . It means if you didn't remove this data form browser manually then it will stay there forever.</p>
        <p>Session storage is almost like local storage. but if you close the tab or reopen the browser then data will be remove. so we can call that it's temporary memory of a browser.</p>
        <p>Cookies is also a data saving format. It can save data via text. it  it mainly use for tracking. Three types of cookies is first party cookies, third party cookies and http only cookies.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold p-3">3. What is even loop and how it works ?</h3>
        <P><span class="font-semibold">Answer:</span> The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</P>
