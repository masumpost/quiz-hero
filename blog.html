    <section>
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold p-3">1. what is the difference between map(), filter(), forEach(), find() ? </h3>
        <p><span class="font-semibold">Answer:</span> 
        map- map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element.it calls a function once for each element in an array.it does not execute the function for empty elements.it does not change the original array.</p>
        <p>forEach: The forEach() method calls a function for each element in an array.This method is not executed for empty elements.</p>
        <p>So we can call that map() and forEach() are similar but map must return an array and forEach don't return anything.</p>
        <p>filter(): it contains an condition. If the condition is true then it shows all the matching value.</p>
        <p>find(): It also contains a condition . If the condition is true then it shows only the first matching one.</p>
        <p>So, we can call that filter and find method are almost same. The difference is filter shows all of matching and find shows first matching one.</p>
